# Android Data Binding adapters

This project provides reusable adapters and functions for linking `Observable`
arrays and maps to UI elements, such as `ListView` and `LinearLayout`. Binding
adapters for a few other useful properties are included as well.

An example use of these binding adapters is provided (partially because *using*
the bound variables in at least one layout is required for the code to compile).
