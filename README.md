# Android Application Skeleton

This project provides an empty Android application structure. It's designed to
be forked and then imported into Android Studio instead of using the "Create New
Project" wizard. That way everything you need is already added to the git
repository, and you can begin writing code immediately.

After forking and importing this repository, be sure to rename the application
identifier to something other than `com.example.application`.

The `gradle` configuration in this project requires Android Studio 3.0 or newer.
